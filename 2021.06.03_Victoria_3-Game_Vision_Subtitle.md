## Intro 1
1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,920
PEGI 12

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,520
Victoria 3 is a grand-strategy game that takes place  

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:20,400
between the beginning of the victorian age, 
in the 1830s to the early 20th century.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,000
The 19th century saw the expansion of 
railways, the invention of the telegraph,  

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,480
mighty steamships, new weapons of war, and 
most importantly, new ways of viewing the world.
## Intro 2
6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,280
So I want to start by touching a little bit on 
the past of the series and what made Victoria 1  

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,200
and 2 what they are and what made Victoria 2 
such a popular game and I really think it is  

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:57,120
because the games focus so much on internal 
management of your population, your economy,  

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,560
and the sense that you're ruling over real 
people in a real society. 

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,906
What's really important and what sets the franchise apart as a series is the emphasis

11
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:13,531
 on the political and economic management of your country 

12
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:18,673
and that connection isn't something that we see in any games to my knowledge. 

13
00:01:18,673 --> 00:01:23,447
So something that really sets the Victoria games apart from our other titles,

14
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:27,920
is that there is a lot of focus 
inwards; what's happening inside your borders  

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,560
rather than all of what's going on outside of your 
borders and in relations with other countries.

## Population Management

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:43,227
We have the simulation running underneath 
you don't have to look at it in detail on a day-by-day basis 

17
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:48,080
but we aggregate all that information to you. So we show you trends we show you charts.

18
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:59,252
We show you averages. if you want to 
dig in and find out exactly what a farmer in Brandenburg 

19
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:05,686
working on the wheat farms thinks about the politics of  your country you can do that,

20
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:09,288
but you don't have to do that in order to play the game.  

21
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:16,480
There is a lot going on especially with the 
pops. There is a huge complex simulation but we  

22
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:24,960
give the player tools to work with that. So for 
example the leader of a million-plus population  

23
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,120
country doesn't ask each individual person in the 
entire population what they want. They interact  

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,800
through parties to political movements and through 
other such collections and that's what we tried to  

25
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,087
recreate through the mechanics of Victoria 3.

26
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:43,332
 So this lets us have really interesting laws as well  

27
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,640
that can provide really powerful impact on your 
population when you do things like pass women's  

28
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,600
suffrage or even laws that permit women in the 
workplace. These are new dynamics and new depth  

29
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,920
to the population system that we didn't have 
before and that's really exciting to me.  

30
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,680
To make sure that we actually simulate the world's 
population and not just a fraction of it.  

## Society Building


31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,280
When it comes to the player goals and you know, 
"What is the aim of a campaign?" "What are you trying to do?"

32
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,840
 I think this is also where 
the society-building aspects of Victoria really shine true.

33
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,880
 Because in a lot of games 
the goal is more like "I want to take over this territory,"

34
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,800
 "I want to restore this empire," but 
it can be very different than in war-focused games  

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,400
because instead, it can be about "I just want to 
take this country and I want its people to have a good life."

36
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,920
 You don't have to have a 
grand ambition to go forth. You can. We always want that. 

37
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:51,040
But it can be just as satisfying to just take what's there and build something.

38
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:59,840
Build your own little piece of the world just as you want it.

## Economics


39
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:08,560
So most of our economic model is built on the 
idea of supply and demand: "homo economicus"   

40
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,800
In Victoria 3 that isn't the only way that pop units 
make their purchase decisions. 

41
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:24,160
We have a good  substitution system. So pops have certain needs 
like the need for luxuries or the need for staple goods,

42
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:32,160
and the goods that they choose are often 
based on what is most available in their market  

43
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:40,160
and what is cheapest, but in some cases, entire 
cultures can become fascinated with certain goods  

44
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:47,680
over other goods. So their need for luxurious 
exotic drinks might favor tea instead of coffee if  

45
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,200
you don't provide it to them they're going to get 
very upset. Their wealth is going to drop. There's  

46
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,480
going to be more radicals and you're going to 
have to deal with that. So underlying Victoria 3  

47
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:05,440
is this very complex economic simulation and 
that's what drives the game and even its politics.

## Conflicts & Diplomacy

48
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,320
One thing with Victoria 3 that has been a very 
stated design goal from the start is that we are  

49
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,680
not making a war game. We are not making a map 
painter. We are making a game where war takes a  

50
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,080
little bit of a back seat. That is not to say that 
war isn't in the game. Of course, in a historical  

51
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,240
simulation of the 19th century, the 19th century 
was not, unfortunately, entirely peaceful. So war,  

52
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,240
of course, happens. It can be a way to get things 
you want, but anything you can get through war  

53
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,320
you can also get through diplomacy. Ideally, 
you should want to try to solve this conflict  

54
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,120
before it escalates into war. 
If it does escalate into war  

55
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,920
maybe that'll work out well for you, but a lot of 
your people are going to die. One way or another,  

56
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,000
it's always best to try to avoid it if possible.

57
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,840
We start the game in 1836. We end in 1936. 
One thing that was definitely happening,  

58
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:15,680
there was immense technological change and immense 
political change compared to previous eras in  

59
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:23,120
history. Life could change rapidly in five to ten 
years just from the result of a new invention. And  

60
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:31,280
that of course makes the inward aspects the aspect 
of focusing on your people and their lives that  

61
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:38,560
much more interesting. The 19th century is also 
a fantastic era for alternative history because  

62
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,200
there is so much potential for things to have 
played out differently. But also because it's  

63
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,880
the era that shaped our era. I think it's really 
exciting to get the sense of being able to look  

64
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,720
into the future of your campaign and imagine 
a different world right here and right now.

## Better Accessibility

65
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:06,000
Victoria 3 is, and should be, a deep game with 
a lot of mechanics and potential complexity,  

66
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and that's not something we want to change, 
but we have prioritized accessibility. Not  

67
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,880
in the sense of one extreme, streamline 
or just make the game simpler, but build  

68
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,720
the interface, the tools, and the information 
that the player needs to be able to grasp  

69
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,840
and understand, and eventually 
master all of this complexity.

## A Living Simulation


70
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,960
As armchair economists and politicians we can sit 
and theorize "if this happens then these knock-on  

71
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,920
effects would happen and then society would be 
shaped this way." This game actually lets you  

72
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:54,400
play out uh and test your theories. So while 
you have people working in your textile mills  

73
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,040
that doesn't just mean, "+15 luxury clothes, 
happiness goes up!" No, what it means is that  

74
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,440
you produce some more luxury clothes. The people 
buying luxury clothes are the upper strata of your  

75
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,440
society and their happiness doesn't just go up. 
What happens is the price of luxury clothes goes  

76
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,760
down so their income will stretch higher. Their 
wealth will go up they will gain more loyalists  

77
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:26,320
in their pot. That means their interest group 
will become happier and will support you more. So  

78
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:32,240
by expanding this textile mill, the knock-on 
effect is that now you might be able to pass  

79
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:40,080
a law without the landowners interfering 
in your affairs. And this is the sort of  

80
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,640
long-term thinking and creative solutions 
that we really want players to first theorize,  

81
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,240
and then carry out and test the theory, and see if 
there are any additional things that they didn't  

82
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,800
think about. What really really excites me is just 
the opportunity to get to grips with all of these  

83
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,920
things. The ability to build a complex economic 
model where everything ties into one another. A  

84
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,080
game where the politics is not just a sideshow but 
so core to the experience of the game. And again,  

85
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,680
where everything ultimately hooks back and you 
can look at your society and you can feel the  

86
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,200
decisions and changes made along the way. I'm 
just really excited to be a part of this project  

87
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,960
and the players who have been waiting for 
victoria 3 for years and years and years.  

88
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:32,240
I really hope that in the end, we will 
be able to provide you with the armchair  

89
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,760
economist armchair politician kind of fantasy 
that you've been waiting so patiently for.

## Conclusion

90
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,920
So that was a little bit about the overall vision 
of victoria 3 but of course, there's a lot of  

91
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,680
detail and nuance to all of this and all of the 
features and mechanics we have in the game. So  

92
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:58,000
starting soon we are going to be covering a lot of 
these in coming dev-diaries. Next up is a pretty  

93
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,560
significant overview of a lot of the basic things 
in victoria 3, like POPs how do they work? What  

94
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,560
are they? and what changes and what things have we 
actually made deeper since the previous Victoria  

95
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,840
games? Here we'll be talking about building 
capacities and a whole lot of other things.
